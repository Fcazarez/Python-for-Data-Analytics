Topic Challenge - Working with cvs files
Professor: Laurie Cutrone
Student: Felix Cazarez
Programming for Data Science
Using your favorite text editor, create a weather.csv file with the following lines, making sure there are no spaces in between items:
"Temp", "Press", "Humidity"

1.1, 55.5, 22.2

3.3, 4.4, 6.6

8.8, 99.9, 7.7

Write a function that reads the CSV file into a dictionary and calculates the average temperature.

Print out all the original data and the average temperature on the screen.

​
def read_csv(file_name):
    '''read_csv function takes in the scv file as a parameter and 
    opens it using the with statement to ensure the file is properly closed even if an error occurs'''
    # Open the file for reading and use the with statement to ensure it is properly closed
    with open(file_name, "r") as file:
               
        # Skip the first line
        file.readline() 
        
        # Use a list comprehension to extract the first item (temperature) from each line in the file, which is split by the comma (',') delimiter
        data = [float(line.split(',')[0]) for line in file]
        
        # Calculate the average temperature by summing up all the temperature values and dividing by the number of values
        avg_data = sum(data) / len(data)
        
        # Return the average temperature value
        return avg_data
​
​
# Define the file name and path
file_path = "D:/RRC_DSML/Second_Term/COMP-2040_Python/Challenge_csv_files/Data_challenge.csv"
'''print data and average using created function'''
​
#file is oppened again to print the data in first row
with open(file_path, "r") as file:
    data_print = [line.split(',')[0] for line in file]
for i in data_print:
   print(i)
​
#print average usin preconfigured function
print("Average Temperature:", avg_data)
​
Temp
1.1
3.3
8.8
Average Temperature: 4.4
