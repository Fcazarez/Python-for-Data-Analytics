Description: This code allows a user to choose a robot from a list and displays its stats. 
The data for each robot are stored in a text file named "cards.txt" and are read into the program at runtime.
The data is stored in a dictionary with the robot's name as the key and the data as a list of values. 
If the user inputs "random", the program will choose a random robot from the list. 
If the user inputs a valid robot name, the stats for that robot are displayed on the screen using turtle graphics'''

# Import the turtle library and the choice function from the random library
from turtle import *
from random import choice

# Create a screen object and set its background color to white
screen = Screen()
screen.bgcolor('grey')

# Make the turtle invisible and lift its pen
penup()
hideturtle()

# Create an empty dictionary to store the robot stats
robots = {}

# Open the "cards.txt" file in read mode
file = open('cards.txt', 'r')

# Loop through each line in the file
for line in file.read().splitlines():
  # Split the line into separate values using the comma separator
  name, battery, intelligence, usefulness, speed, image, colour = line.split(', ')
  
  # Store the robot's stats in the robots dictionary with the name as the key
  robots[name] = [battery, intelligence, usefulness, speed, image, colour]
  
  # Register the shape image for the turtle to use
  screen.register_shape(image)

# Close the file
file.close()

# Print the list of robots
print("List of robots: ")
